wait for dll check to complete,
if  it boots the bios then,
first boot in the usb,
and boot the demo
then type "reboot --enable-hdd"
then boot the hdd and type "installapp win95installer"
after installing,
execute it by typeing "setup"
it will fail because the "cpu" is too new.
then type "installapp 95patch"
and after installing it,
type "setup" again
go through the setup
and at the end
press enter
you will get a little message from me
then press enter
then open the drive using the windows file explorer and
add a file called "boot.bat" to the root of it
and put some code in it
then go back to the app
and type "bootdisk --createfile:boot.img --bootimage:command.com, boot.bat"
after saying "completed creating bootfile boot.img",
type "bootdisk --bootfile:boot.img"
this will open the .bat file
and thats it for now!
